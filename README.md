# Priority Shifts

Priortiy Shifts are required if transport for NSW requires an event timetable to be activated for bus operators for a certain period of time to transport people from point A to B, these require 10 to 15 minute frequent bus services on selected routes which need to be fulfilled by drivers along with the normal bus timetable.


These shifts are completely different to normal shifts when you are signing on, these shifts are optional but can have bigger rewards and pay if you decide to take on one of the positions needed, these priority shifts are essential to be taken by transport officers to stop over crowding on normal bus services and event buses and to make sure that everyone on the bus follows regulations and taps on with opal cards.

**These shifts are most likely to be available during a priority shift for Transport Officers:**

Compensations are given to the Transport Officers who commit to a Priority Shift position.
